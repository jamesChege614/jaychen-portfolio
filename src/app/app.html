    <h2>DevOps Engineer | Cloud Infrastructure | Automation</h2>
    <h3>Building Systems that are Fast, Secure and Sclalable.</h3>
    <p>
      I am James Chege, a DevOps Engineer with 3.5+ years of experience designing, implementing, and supporting production infrastructure across cloud and on-prem environments. My work focuses on automation, CI/CD pipelines, containerized deployments, and system reliability — helping teams deliver faster while maintaining stability and security.
      
      I thrive in remote environments that require ownership, clear documentation, and disciplined execution, and I enjoy turning complex infrastructure challenges into scalable, maintainable solutions.

  <div class="story-content">
    <p>
      My journey into DevOps and cloud engineering started from a hands-on technical background in computer systems and support. Early in my career, I worked closely with hardware, operating systems and enterprise networks, which gave me a strong foundation in troubleshooting and understanding how systems behave under real-world conditions.
    </p>
    <p>
      Over time, I moved into implementing and managing business infrastructure including servers, virtualization environments, networking components and application platforms. This experience exposed me to the operational challenges organizations face, from reliability issues to deployment complexity and helped me develop a practical mindset focused on stability, efficiency and maintainability.
    </p>
    <p>
      Transitioning into DevOps was a natural progression. It allowed me to combine infrastructure knowledge with automation, version control, and modern deployment practices. I began working more deeply with cloud platforms, CI/CD pipelines, containerized environments and monitoring systems, focusing on improving deployment workflows and system reliability.
    </p>
    <p>
      Today, I approach engineering from a lifecycle perspective — design, implementation, deployment, monitoring, and continuous improvement. I value clear documentation, thoughtful architecture decisions and solutions that teams can operate confidently over time. My goal is always to build systems that are not only functional, but resilient, scalable and easy to manage.

      <h2>Engineering Philosophy</h2>

      <p>
        Modern organizations depend heavily on technology, yet many systems struggle with reliability, scalability and operational complexity. 
        I believe infrastructure should not just function, it should enable teams to move faster, operate confidently and focus on delivering value.
      </p>

      <p>
        My approach to engineering focuses on simplicity, automation and maintainability. Rather than introducing unnecessary complexity, I aim to build solutions that are clear, well-documented and sustainable over time.
      </p>

      <p>
        In practice, this means:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>Designing infrastructure that scales predictably with business demand</li>
        <li>Automating repetitive processes to reduce human error and improve consistency</li>
        <li>Improving system visibility through monitoring and observability</li>
        <li>Prioritizing reliability, security, and operational clarity</li>
        <li>Creating documentation and workflows that support distributed teams</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        I value environments where engineering decisions are driven by long-term stability and measurable impact rather than short-term fixes. 
        My goal is always to contribute to systems that teams trust and can operate confidently regardless of location or time zone.
