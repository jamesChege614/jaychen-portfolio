      <p>
        I am James Chege — a Kenyan cloud, systems, DevOps, and site reliability engineer who believes in the transformative power of having reliable systems. My journey began early in my childhood when I was curious about how gadgets work and how to restore things that had failed.

<!-- Journey / Story Section -->
<section id="story" class="story-section">
  <div class="story-content">
    <p>
      I graduated in 2019 from Dedan Kimathi University of Technology with a degree in Purchasing and Supplies Management, hoping that the degree would open doors. But after graduation, reality hit—no job offers, no callbacks. Instead of waiting, I began building. I started a cyber café, offering services like printing, design, and digital support. When COVID-19 hit, and everything shut down, I discovered freelancing, and it changed my life.
    </p>
    <p>
      Since then, I have trained over 5,000 people—both through paid and free programs—in areas such as graphic design, content creation, digital literacy, AI tools, and more. My story is one of resilience, and this site is dedicated to empowering others to take their first or next step in the digital economy.
    </p>
    <p>
      Today, I run a digital marketing agency called Tera Creations and an e-learning platform known as Click2Skill. I’ve also grown a social media following of over 1 million combined across TikTok, LinkedIn, Facebook, Instagram, Telegram, and WhatsApp.
    </p>
    <p>
      My work centers around one mission: to equip individuals and businesses with the tools, systems, and mindset needed to grow online, build visibility, and generate sustainable income.
